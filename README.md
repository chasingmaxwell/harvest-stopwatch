# harvest-stopwatch

Ever forget to turn your timer back on in Harvest and have to guess how long you'd been working on a given task? harvest-stopwatch can help! harvest-stopwatch is a userscript which logs to the console every time you stop a timer in Harvest. If you can't remember when you stopped the timer on an open harvest tab, simply open up your browser's console and there it will be.

## Installation:

Make sure you install a userscript engine like [Tampermonk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) and then follow this link:

## @TODO:
- Use something more helpful than the console.
- Persist the log outside a single Harvest tab.
- Stop using jQuery.
